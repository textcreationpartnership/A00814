            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reverend Author on his severall workes.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>SIR, I not praise your witt, for that (all know)</l>
               <l>Praises it selfe: each line that thence doth flow</l>
               <l>Like to some pearle, or ray, or streame, well showes</l>
               <l>The Mine, Sunne, Fountaine, whence it first arose.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But that which ravishes iust praise from me,</l>
               <l>Is the choice method of your Poetrie;</l>
               <l>And that you could with such due equipage</l>
               <l>Sute seuerall poems to your severall age:</l>
               <l>So that in this your exemplary art</l>
               <l>Acts both the Poets, and the Preachers part.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Your younger wit, (as taking a delight</l>
               <l>In bold endeavours) ventur'd to recite</l>
               <l>The deeds of valiant Drake who by your skill,</l>
               <l>And strong descriptions, goes that voiage still</l>
               <l>Which once he did, and with full blasts of fame</l>
               <l>Yet sailes, (securely) round the earth againe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then, as experience taught you to survay</l>
               <l>The Worlds conditions, your free Muse would play</l>
               <l>In various Epigramms, where both for tongue,</l>
               <l>Conceit, and choise of verse, you seeme to runne</l>
               <l>With foremost Martiall, and so thriue therein;</l>
               <l>That you come nearest to the Goale next him.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>But having now retreated from the fome</l>
               <l>Of surging youth, and safe at length come home</l>
               <l>To quiet age, diviner thoughts inspire</l>
               <l>Your pregnant fancy, and with holier fire</l>
               <l>In flame you to the sweet discovery</l>

               <l>The Natalls of our Saviour, which so well</l>
               <l>You haue perform'd with each nice circumstance</l>
               <l>Of time, and place, and persons, to advance</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:2263:3"/>
               <l>Such lofty wonders, that you make to vs</l>

            <lg>
               <l>This is your praise: but will you heare me noise</l>
               <l>The shame of others that grow old in toies,</l>
               <l>Write plaies with spectacles, and spend an age</l>
               <l>Past threescore yeares on sonnets, and the stage:</l>
               <l>That chafe their palsied fancies, and molest</l>
               <l>With a forc't flame those embers that would rest:</l>
               <l>That bald, and dry, and sere, and wither'd, yet</l>
               <l>Yeild blossoms still, and chilblaines of their wit:</l>
               <l>As if (like Hesiod's infants) they still were</l>
               <l>But children at their almost hundreth yeare:</l>
               <l>That thinke their wild inventions too much pent</l>
               <l>In sacred taskes, and not their element</l>
               <l>To be in heavenly things, as if such stuff</l>
               <l>Were not conceited, rich, and fine enough</l>
               <l>For their loose numbers, or could not yeeld straines</l>
               <l>Of matter high enough to fill their veines</l>
               <l>With raptures; but o! how is this made vaine</l>
               <l>By noble Bartas! whose Heroicke braine</l>
               <l>Adorn'd Gods works, and like another light,</l>
               <l>Pictur'd the whole creation to our sight.</l>
               <l>Nay how is this made lye by those Saint-men,</l>
               <l>(Those spheares of witt) Tertullian, Nazianzen,</l>
               <l>Nissen, Lactantius, and more of that crue,</l>
               <l>That could be Fathers, and yet Poets too;</l>
               <l>And when they could not their rude enemies pierce</l>
               <l>With gentle prose, they batter'd them with verse,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But let them passe, and sucke the empty shout</l>
               <l>Of lewd applauses, which will shortly out</l>
               <l>In stench, and rottennesse, and then commit</l>
               <l>Their Authors to the <hi>Iudgement</hi> of their wit.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
